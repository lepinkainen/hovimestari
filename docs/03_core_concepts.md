# Core Concepts

## Memories

Memories are the fundamental data units in Hovimestari. Each memory represents a piece of information stored in the SQLite database with the following attributes:

- **Content**: The actual information (e.g., "Calendar Event: Meeting with John from 2025-04-20 14:00 to 15:00")
- **CreatedAt**: When the memory was added to the database
- **RelevanceDate**: When the memory is relevant (e.g., the date of a calendar event)
- **Source**: Where the memory came from (e.g., "calendar:work", "weather:helsinki", "manual")
- **UID**: Optional unique identifier (used for calendar events to prevent duplicates)

## Importers

Importers fetch data from external sources and store them as memories in the database:

- **Calendar Importer**: Fetches events from WebCal/iCalendar URLs
- **Weather Importer**: Fetches weather forecasts from the MET Norway API

## Briefs

Briefs are daily summaries generated by the LLM based on relevant memories. They include:

- Today's date and weather
- Ongoing events
- Today's calendar events
- Upcoming days' events and weather
- Special notifications (birthdays, high UV index, etc.)

Briefs are generated in Finnish with a formal, butler-like tone.
