# Contributing to Hovimestari

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hovimestari!

## Project Background

Hovimestari started as a personal project, designed to be a helpful AI butler assistant.

While it was initially built for specific personal needs, it turned out it could be easily adapted to be more generic in terms of content handling and output language configuration.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy of the project.
2.  **Create a branch:** Make a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3.  **Make your changes:** Implement your feature or fix the bug.
4.  **Add tests:** If you are adding new functionality or modifying existing logic, please include tests to verify your changes. This helps ensure the stability and correctness of the codebase. Refer to the existing tests for examples.
5.  **Commit your changes:** Use clear and concise commit messages (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
6.  **Push to your branch:** (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
