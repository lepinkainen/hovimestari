# Hovimestari Project Context

This document provides detailed technical information about the Hovimestari project structure, architecture, and implementation details. It is designed to help LLM agents and developers understand the project quickly.

## Project Overview

Hovimestari ("Butler" in Finnish) is a personal AI butler assistant that generates daily briefs in Finnish. It collects "memories" from various sources (calendar events, weather forecasts, manual notes) and uses Google's Gemini LLM to generate personalized daily summaries.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Database:** SQLite (using `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`)
- **LLM:** Google Gemini (using `github.com/google/generative-ai-go`)
- **Calendar Parsing:** iCalendar (using `github.com/apognu/gocal`)
- **Weather API:** MET Norway Locationforecast API
- **CLI Framework:** Cobra (`github.com/spf13/cobra`)
- **Build System:** Go Modules, Makefile

- **cmd/hovimestari/main.go**: Contains the CLI command definitions using Cobra. Defines commands for importing calendar events, importing weather forecasts, generating briefs, adding memories manually, and initializing configuration.

- **internal/brief/brief.go**: Handles the generation of daily briefs by combining memories from the database with context information (date, time, weather, birthdays, etc.) and sending them to the LLM.

- **internal/config/config.go**: Manages loading and saving application configuration from `config.json`. Defines the configuration structure including database path, API keys, location information, calendars, and family members.

- **internal/importer/calendar/calendar.go**: Fetches and parses calendar events from WebCal URLs and stores them as memories in the database.

- **internal/importer/weather/weather.go**: Imports weather forecasts from the MET Norway API and stores them as memories.

- **internal/llm/gemini.go**: Provides the client for interacting with the Google Gemini API, including methods for generating briefs and responses to user queries.

- **internal/store/store.go**: Manages the SQLite database connection and operations for adding and querying memories.

- **internal/weather/metno.go**: Fetches weather forecasts from the MET Norway Locationforecast API.

- **prompts.json**: Contains the prompt templates used for generating briefs and responses to user queries.

- **config.example.json**: An example configuration file showing the required structure and fields.

## Core Concepts

### Memories

Memories are the fundamental data units in Hovimestari. Each memory represents a piece of information stored in the SQLite database with the following attributes:

- **Content**: The actual information (e.g., "Calendar Event: Meeting with John from 2025-04-20 14:00 to 15:00")
- **CreatedAt**: When the memory was added to the database
- **RelevanceDate**: When the memory is relevant (e.g., the date of a calendar event)
- **Source**: Where the memory came from (e.g., "calendar:work", "weather:helsinki", "manual")
- **UID**: Optional unique identifier (used for calendar events to prevent duplicates)

### Importers

Importers fetch data from external sources and store them as memories in the database:

- **Calendar Importer**: Fetches events from WebCal/iCalendar URLs
- **Weather Importer**: Fetches weather forecasts from the MET Norway API

### Briefs

Briefs are daily summaries generated by the LLM based on relevant memories. They include:

- Today's date and weather
- Ongoing events
- Today's calendar events
- Upcoming days' events and weather
- Special notifications (birthdays, high UV index, etc.)

Briefs are generated in Finnish with a formal, butler-like tone.

### Configuration

The application is configured through a `config.json` file with the following key sections:

- **Database**: Path to the SQLite database file
- **LLM**: Google Gemini API key, model name, and output language
- **Location**: Name, coordinates, and timezone for weather forecasts
- **Calendars**: List of calendars to import events from
- **Family**: List of family members with optional birthdays
- **Output**: Format for displaying briefs (currently only CLI)

## Database Schema

The SQLite database (`memories.db`) has a single table called `memories` with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE memories (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    relevance_date TIMESTAMP,
    source TEXT NOT NULL,
    uid TEXT
);
```

Indexes are created on `relevance_date`, `source`, and the combination of `source` and `uid` to optimize queries.

## LLM Interaction

The application interacts with Google's Gemini LLM through the `internal/llm/gemini.go` module:

1. Prompt templates are stored in `prompts.json` with placeholders for dynamic content
2. The `BuildBriefPrompt` method combines memories, user context, and the prompt template
3. The `Generate` method sends the prompt to the Gemini API and receives the response
4. The response is returned to the user in the specified output format

Prompts include placeholders like `%LANG%` for output language, `%NOTES%` for memories, and `%CONTEXT%` for user context information.

## CLI Commands

The application provides several CLI commands through the Cobra framework:

- **import-calendar**: Import events from configured WebCal URLs
- **import-weather**: Import weather forecasts for the configured location
- **generate-brief**: Generate a daily brief based on stored memories
- **add-memory**: Add a memory manually
- **init-config**: Initialize the configuration file
- **list-models**: List available Gemini models
- **show-brief-context**: Show the context that would be sent to the LLM

## Configuration File Example

  "db_path": "memories.db",
  "gemini_api_key": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY",
  "gemini_model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
  "outputLanguage": "Finnish",
  "promptFilePath": "prompts.json",
  "location_name": "Helsinki",
  "latitude": 60.1699,
  "longitude": 24.9384,
  "timezone": "Europe/Helsinki",
  "calendars": [
    {
      "name": "Family Calendar",
      "url": "webcal://example.com/calendar.ics"
    }
  ],
  "family": [
    {
      "name": "Matti",
      "birthday": "1980-05-15"
    }
  ],
  "output_format": "cli"
}
```

## Prompt Structure

Prompts are defined in `prompts.json` and include detailed instructions for the LLM:

- **dailyBrief**: Template for generating daily briefs
- **userQuery**: Template for responding to user queries

Each prompt includes placeholders for dynamic content and specific instructions on tone, structure, and content.
